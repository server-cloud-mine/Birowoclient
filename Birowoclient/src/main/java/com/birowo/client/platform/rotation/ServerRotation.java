/**
 * The rotation the server is told about, which is not always the rotation the player sees.
 *
 * <p>A silent rotation is applied by two pieces of code that cannot see each other: the feature
 * that aims at the target writes the rotation here, and the mixin that swaps the rotation into
 * the movement packets reads it. A static holder is the only thing the two can share, because a
 * mixin has no access to the objects of the mod.
 *
 * <p>The rotation is only meaningful while {@link #active()} is true. A feature that does not aim
 * at anything clears it, so that the movement packets carry the rotation of the player again.
 *
 * <p>The fields are volatile: the feature that aims writes them on the frame thread, while the
 * mixin reads them on the client thread, when the movement packets are sent.
